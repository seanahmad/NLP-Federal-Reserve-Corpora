At each meeting, it publishes press conference minutes, statements as well as scripts in text. In addition to this regular meetings, the members’ speeches and testimonies are also scripted on the website.\n","At each meeting, the policy makers decide monetary policy and publish the decision along with their view on current economic situation and forecast, including Forward Guidance since 2012. The central banks intend to indicate their potential future monetary policy in their publications as a measure of market communication.\n","The objective of this project is to apply NLP on those text published by FOMC to find latent features. First, I apply machine learning to economic indices to see how the prediction performs. Then, add pre-processed text data as additional feature in traditional machine learning technique to see if it contains the meaningful information. Finally, apply Deep Learning technique such as LSTM/RNN and BERT to see if these can better predict the rate hike/lower at each FOMC meeting.\n","All data used in this analysis are publicly available.\n","\n","<img src='../img/FomcMeetings.png' width=700>\n","\n","FOMC Meeting documents are available here: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm\n","\n","The
